<h1>Module Explorer</h1>

<p>This is a python script that I wrote while trying to teach myself python.
It will display information about the specified python module installed in the system
libraries, including the author's documentation contained in the source file's docstrings.</p>
<br>
<p>It uses the <i>importlib</i> and <i>inspect</i> modules to load and inspect the module dynamically. You'll probably want to pipe the output to less. Running the program with no arguments will give you a usage message.</p>
